# ðŸ§  LocalMind â€“ A Self-Hosted AI Chat App

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

Most AI chat platforms:

- Store your conversations in the cloud
- Require monthly payments
- Restrict which models you can use

I wanted a **private, secure, and cost-free alternative** that I control completely.

With **LocalMind**:

- ðŸ”’ **Full Privacy** â€“ All chats & history are stored locally on **my own device**, not on someone elseâ€™s servers.
- ðŸ§  **Model Freedom** â€“ Download & switch between different local AI models (Gemma, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.).
- ðŸ’¸ **No Subscription Fees** â€“ No API keys, no usage limits, no paywalls.
- âš¡ **Fast & Offline** â€“ Works even without internet after setup.
